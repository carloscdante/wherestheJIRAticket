# Where's the JIRA Ticket?

A utility for engineers who want to work fast and freeform, without getting asked where's the story or ticket. Because that's annoying as hell.

## Why?

This is a bit of a self-explanatory project. It came along out of pure frustration with wanting to push fixes and always having to describe my changes in some sort of convoluted planning way, when I know exactly what to make/what to code but never what exactly to say on the JIRA ticket or story. "Why not infer that from the diff so people can stop asking me where's the ticket?" I thought. Well, LLMs sure make that easy. I don't really care much about hallucinations because what I write on a story does not capture the full picture of the diff anyway, so... yeah. It makes my job faster, and I hope it can make yours faster too.
